# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this guide. You can help make it better by:

1. Opening an issue to provide new library or tool suggestions, typos, or other errors;
2. opening a pull request to fix it yourself.

There is little to no formality in the process. We will review your contribution and merge it if it fits the guide's scope.
