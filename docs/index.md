## What is this?
The standard library in C is much smaller than in Python or Go, for example. Those languages come with "batteries included" support for things like HTTP(S), JSON, timezones and async IO. 

C programmers, on the other hand, are often used to being "self-sufficient" - using a small number of libraries and implementing a lot of logic by own hands. This is due to the fact that C does not have an "all-in-one" package manager and package repository so far, and **the information on the Internet is so fragmented that almost forces one to lose all hope of finding a good library for his/her use case.** They don't know which packages are stable, fully functional, and trustworthy.

To avoid reinventing the wheel, this list is intended to help answer those questions.

**Disclaimer**: This list is not exhaustive and is not intended to be. It is not a list of every C library that exists. It is also not a list of the "best" C libraries, because "best" is subjective. We want to include those well-maintained, well-documented, and well-tested libraries that are widely used and have a good reputation. **But even in these areas, it is possible to miss something with only a few searches and comparisons. If you find something wrong, don't hesitate to [come and help us refine it](https://github.com/w568w/blessed-c/)! :)**
